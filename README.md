## Challenges

### Challenge 1: Student Grade Generator

The `studentGradeGenerator` function prompts the user to input student marks and assigns a grade based on predefined criteria:

- A > 79
- B - 60 to 79
- C - 59 to 49
- D - 40 to 49
- E - less than 40

**Solution:** `studentGradeGenerator.js`

### Challenge 2: Speed Detector

The `speedDetector` function calculates demerit points based on the speed of a car compared to a speed limit of 70 km/h. It determines if the driver's license should be suspended based on accumulated demerit points.

**Solution:** `speedDetector.js`

### Challenge 3: Net Salary Calculator

The `calculateNetSalary` function computes an individualâ€™s net salary based on inputs of basic salary and benefits. It calculates PAYE (Tax), NHIF Deductions, NSSF Deductions, gross salary, and net salary according to KRA guidelines.

**Solution:** `netSalaryCalculator.js`
