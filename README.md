## Challenges

### Challenge 1: Student Grade Generator

The `studentGradeGenerator` function prompts the user to input student marks and assigns a grade based on predefined criteria:

- A > 79
- B - 60 to 79
- C - 59 to 49
- D - 40 to 49
- E - less than 40

**File:** `studentGradeGenerator.js`

**Criteria:** The function prompts the user for input, validates the input, and correctly maps the input to the appropriate grade.

### Challenge 2: Speed Detector

The `speedDetector` function calculates demerit points based on the speed of a car compared to a speed limit of 70 km/h. It determines if the driver's license should be suspended based on accumulated demerit points.

**File:** `speedDetector.js`

**Criteria:** The function correctly takes speed input, evaluates it, and prints the appropriate message or demerit points.

### Challenge 3: Net Salary Calculator

The `calculateNetSalary` function computes an individualâ€™s net salary based on inputs of basic salary and benefits. It calculates PAYE (Tax), NHIF Deductions, NSSF Deductions, gross salary, and net salary according to KRA guidelines.

**File:** `netSalaryCalculator.js`

This code is produced based on information from the website: 
[https://www.aren.co.ke/payroll/taxrates.htm](https://www.aren.co.ke/payroll/taxrates.htm)

**Criteria:** The program correctly calculates the net salary including tax, NHIF, and NSSF deductions.

## Technologies Used

- **JavaScript:** Used to write the solutions for the coding challenges.

## How to Run

Each challenge is self-contained in its respective JavaScript file. You can run each file individually using Node.js or directly in your browser's console.

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome! If you'd like to improve the solutions or add more challenges, feel free to fork the repository and submit a pull request.
